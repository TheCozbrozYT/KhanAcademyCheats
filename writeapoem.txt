    <h1> The poem about an elephant and  a telephone</h1>
    
   <p> Once there was an elephant, <br>
Who tried to use the telephant <br>
No! No! I mean an elephone<br>
Who tried to use the telephone<br>

(Dear me! I am not certain quite<br>
That even now I’ve got it right.)<br>
Howe’er it was, he got his trunk<br>
Entangled in the telephunk;<br>

The more he tried to get it free,<br>
The louder buzzed the telephee<br>
(I fear I’d better drop the song<br>
Of elephop and telephong!)<br>

This children’s poem will certainly not be irrelephant in your<br> household as your kids will be giggling for days. Make them laugh<br> even more with these silly puns for kids.<br> </p>
